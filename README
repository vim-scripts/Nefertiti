A warm dark-background color scheme for Vim, featuring dynamic control of brightness-levels as needed.

Brighten select (normal and syntax) colors with ":NefertitiBrighten", or darken them with ":NefertitiDarken". Conveniently bound to "META-2" and "META-1", respectively, but you can, of course, suppress the key mappings and/or replace them with others of your own preference.

NOTE: 
    (1) GUI Vim only at the present time.
    (2) Previously known as "MochaLatte"
